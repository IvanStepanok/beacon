## 🆕 2026-06-10 session — changelog (verification quality + public tier + submission docs)

Fixes from the security audit + external review, landing as one change set across all three repos:

Backend:
- Public-view coarsening is DONE (was "in progress" in the 2026-06-09 audit). Anonymous + `external_viewer` callers get verified-only reports through the locked-down public projection (~110 m coords, PII/operational fields stripped). Implemented in `backend/internal/handler/handlers.go` (`publicProjection`), enforced across reports/map/tiles/stats; the security table below was updated accordingly.
- No earthquake default. A report with no hazard selected is stored with an empty `crisisNature`, no longer silently defaulted to `earthquake`.
- Geographic containment. A report claiming a pinned crisis must fall inside that crisis's spatial extent, else it goes through normal space+time assignment (no more cross-country attachments).
- Verification photo-gate. Verifying a photo-less report requires an explicit analyst `force` + note, both audited (`report_verification_audit`).
- New report fields: `infraName` (named facility), `buildingSource` (`"footprint"` only when a real footprint polygon was tapped; `buildingId` is set solely from that tap, as a stable `fp-` polygon hash; GPS-only reports carry no building identity, just the pin + accuracy; landmark-only reports are `locationResolved=false`), `plusCode` formalized (legacy `what3words` slot retired).
- Dynamic form-schema endpoint. Clients fetch the capture-form schema (incl. modular questions) from the server, with per-crisis require/hide overrides. Exports keep three stable modular columns (`electricity`/`health_services`/`pressing_needs`) and derive any extra modular sections dynamically from the report data, so new modular sections appear in exports automatically.
- Durable photo storage. Uploaded photos persist on the named `beacon-photos` volume across redeploys; seed photos now ship real CC-attributed imagery with relative timestamps.

Mobile (KMP):
- Dynamic form rendering. The capture wizard's modular step renders from the server's form schema (per-crisis require/hide overrides honored, required-field gating before submit), with an offline cache so the form works with no connectivity.
- GPS-grid building-id removal. The app no longer fabricates a coordinate-grid `buildingId`; only a real tapped footprint produces one (`buildingSource="footprint"`), so the server's 25 m / 10 min near-dup guard actually bites.
- Terminal "Rejected" sync state. Server rejections (409 duplicate, validation) surface as a terminal Rejected state in My Reports instead of silently retrying forever.
- Durable photo storage. Captured photos persist in app storage (not a temp dir), so queued reports keep their evidence across restarts.
- Image downscaling on both platforms (Android + iOS) before upload.
- Honest points copy. Profile points/badges reflect the server-derived verified-only model (no client-side point math presented as truth).
- `plusCode` DTOs. Wire DTOs aligned to the canonical `plusCode` contract field.
- Localized tab labels; fake-UI removals (no simulated affordances left in the shell).
- `crisisId` pinned on submit when reporting into a specific crisis (server containment still decides).
- Landmark/accuracy read-path fixes. Landmark and `gpsAccuracyMeters` round-trip correctly on report reads.

Dashboard: "Dispatch" surface renamed "Verification & triage" (honest framing: Beacon supports verification + triage handoff, it is not a SAR dispatch system) _(this verification & triage / dispatch console was later removed, not in the current build; the shipped flow is inline verify/flag plus the crisis confirm/dismiss lifecycle)_; public `/public` heatmap page (coarsened, verified-only, shareable without login); print brief (one-page situation summary for offline handoff).

Docs: new `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DATA-QUALITY.md`, `INCENTIVES.md`, root `README.md`; honesty pass over STATUS / LOAD-TEST / RAPID-DEPLOYMENT-48H (stale "in progress"/"roadmap" rows, flat-vs-partitioned schema wording, open-source publication status).

---

## 🆕 2026-06-09 session — changelog (all deployed + verified)

A full emulator run of the mobile app + analyst review of the dashboard surfaced bugs; all fixed, plus a new global Area feature. Build artifacts: mobile `assembleDebug` + `compileKotlinIosSimulatorArm64` green; backend at migration v11; dashboard redeployed.

Mobile (KMP), 1 critical + 6 polish fixes:
- 🔴 CRITICAL: app crashed ~6s after cold-launch when the backend was unreachable (offline / DNS fail / rate-limit). Root cause: unprotected cold flows `flow { emit(api.x()) }` in `RemoteRepositories.kt` (`observeProfile`/`observeReport`/`observeBuildingTimeline`/`observeActiveCrisis`/`observeDangerZones`; `observeDangerZones` was later removed with the `/danger-zones` endpoint, not in the current build) threw `UnknownHostException` into a ScreenModel coroutine with no handler; amplified by `MainShellScreen` composing all tabs eagerly. Fix: `.catch { emit(fallback) }` on each; `observeProfile` falls back to a `DeviceId`-based offline profile. Reproduced in airplane mode, now stays alive. (This is a must-have for the "offline-first" requirement.)
- Export "my reports" exported the (empty) community feed, now `observeMyReports()`. Profile stats (0/0/0) now derived from `_mine` (reports/buildings/points). Captured photo not shown in list/detail, now `ReportPhoto`/`CapturedImage`. Own report now appears as a map pin (merge `_mine` into pins). Debris "No" misleading green-check, now Leaf icon. System Back in the capture wizard stepped back instead of discarding the flow (`expect/actual BeaconBackHandler`).

Analyst dashboard:
- Multi-crisis Reports view. Backend `/reports` no longer hard-defaults to `crisis-antakya` (new `listScope`: org-wide scope → all crises, finite scope → `crisis_id = ANY(scope)`); dashboard got a crisis selector (default "All crises", options = crises with reports). Fixes "newly-submitted reports from other crises were invisible".
- Right-side detail panel. Clicking a report opens a drawer (no full-page nav), verify/flag inline with live row update, quick switching; `/reports/[id]` kept for deep links.
- Photo loading. Pending-report photos 404'd for the analyst because `<img>` sends no JWT (the photo endpoint serves unverified photos only to authenticated analysts). New `AuthImage` fetches with the Bearer token to a blob URL.
- Location label. "Your location" replaced with a real place → Plus Code → coords (`locationLabel`); removed the Sync column (every report the dashboard sees is by definition synced).

Backend, global auto-Area (the big one): see the Area roadmap note below. Every report now auto-gets an admin region, worldwide, via an embedded country baseline + lazy geoBoundaries ADM1.

---

## ✅ DONE

### Backend (Go + chi + pgx + PostgreSQL 16 / PostGIS)
- ✅ One camelCase JSON contract serving both clients; idempotent submit (client text id PK, ON CONFLICT).
- ✅ Server-authoritative per-building versioning (version + supersedes computed in tx).
- ✅ 3-level damage scale (minimal / partial / complete) + `possiblyDamaged`.
- ✅ Admin-area tagging: PostGIS `admin_areas`, reverse-geocode via `ST_Contains`, adm1/2/3 + filters (geoBoundaries shapeIDs; official OCHA COD P-code layer on roadmap).
- ✅ Global auto-Area (2026-06-09): `internal/boundary` embeds a Natural Earth ADM0 baseline (177 countries, gives every point a country + resolves ISO3) plus lazy per-country geoBoundaries ADM1 fetched on first report in a country, then existing reports re-geocoded. On-submit hook + startup sweep. `source`/`iso3` precedence (migration 00011). Verified: Ukraine auto-loaded, Kyiv reports got Area "Kyiv". See roadmap note for the geoBoundaries-vs-OCHA-P-code nuance.
- ✅ GLIDE event id + crisis response Level.
- _(Removed, not in current build)_ Two-axis verification & triage / dispatch lifecycle (task_status × disposition + assignee/severity/life_safety/clusters). The shipped flow is analyst verify/flag + the crisis emergent confirm/dismiss lifecycle; there is no dispatch/task lifecycle. Audit trail (`report_verification_audit`) is real.
- ✅ Interop exports: GeoJSON, HXL-tagged CSV, GeoPackage (pure-Go), KML, Shapefile.
- ✅ RBAC + JWT: 5 roles (field_validator, co_analyst, regional_analyst, crisis_admin, external_viewer), bcrypt, crisis-scoping, audit actor from token. Reporters stay anonymous (X-Device-Id).
- ✅ Stats overview in one SQL aggregate; rate limiting; health/readiness; embedded migrations (v15); seed (golden test).
- ✅ Deployed (Docker compose, PostGIS, env-configured, HTTPS).

### Analyst console (Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind + MapLibre)
- ✅ Live API (no mock layer) + auth (login, token, 401→/login) + role-based UI gating.
- ✅ Overview (stats, 3-level damage breakdown, time-series, areas, Verified % tile), Live map (clustered pins, filters), Reports (filter/verify/flag + building timeline), public /public heatmap (coarsened, verified-only). _(The "Verification & triage console" with a life-safety fast lane / assign-advance-close tasks was removed, not in the current build; the shipped flow is inline verify/flag plus the crisis confirm/dismiss lifecycle.)_
- ✅ Export buttons (GeoJSON / HXL-CSV / GeoPackage / KML / Shapefile). Deployed as standalone Node container.

### Reporter mobile app (KMP + Compose Multiplatform, Android + iOS)
- ✅ Architecture: Voyager nav + MVI + Koin; offline-first repository interfaces; MapLibre map.
- ✅ Wired to the live backend over Ktor (Android OkHttp / iOS Darwin), pointed at beacon-api.stepanok.com.
- ✅ Real connectivity (Android ConnectivityManager / iOS NWPathMonitor): honest online/offline, no fake banner.
- ✅ Real sync: optimistic outbox + real POST + auto-flush on reconnect (no simulated byte-progress).
- ✅ Real GPS (Android LocationManager / iOS CLLocationManager) + runtime permission; capture geotags from the device fix; "Locating…" state until a real fix (no fake default accuracy).
- ✅ Real live in-app camera: CameraX (Android) / AVFoundation (iOS) live preview, shutter, flash/torch, lens switch; gallery fallback. EXIF GPS/timestamp/device tags stripped on capture.
- ✅ Real offline map packs: MapLibre OfflineManager (Android, verified) / MLNOfflineStorage (iOS) with real download progress.
- ✅ Real offline location code: Open Location Code (Plus Code) computed on-device (replaces the placeholder what3words; free, no API key, works offline).
- ✅ Full capture flow (camera → 3-level damage (minimal / partial / complete) → infra → crisis → debris → location/footprint snap + anti-duplication → describe → modular → review → submit).
- ✅ Map (clustered pins, filters, hotspots), My Reports, Crisis & Safety _(the `/danger-zones` endpoint was removed, not in the current build; this surface shows crisis info, not a danger-zones feed)_, Profile (anonymous identity, points, export, offline maps, language).
- ✅ 6 UN languages + Arabic RTL. On-device export (GeoJSON/CSV) via share sheet.
- ✅ Safe-area handling (iOS Dynamic Island + home indicator, Android status/gesture bars) across all chrome.
- ✅ Onboarding shown once (persisted via Prefs / SharedPreferences + NSUserDefaults).
- ✅ Builds green: Android `assembleDebug`; iOS full Xcode app builds + runs on simulator (MapLibre SPM wired).

### Docs & governance
- ✅ `docs/OPERATIONAL-MODEL.md` + `docs/governance/` (DPIA, retention/destruction, controller+breach SOP, data-sharing+sovereignty), research-grounded.

## 🔲 NOT DONE / ROADMAP

### Security & privacy controls — D4 hardening (implemented 2026-06-15) + remaining roadmap

The 2026-06-15 security pass (D4) implemented the four controls that were previously
[Planned]: encryption at rest, enforced DB-transit TLS, analyst MFA, and mobile certificate
pinning. Two controls remain roadmap (automated retention purge, on-device photo pruning),
still tagged [Planned] in the DPIA and not to be cited as active.

| Control | State |
|---|---|
| **Encryption at rest** (photos + MFA secrets) | **IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-15.** Report photos are AES-256-GCM encrypted on the volume (upload + seed paths) and analyst TOTP secrets are encrypted in the DB, via `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32-byte; required in prod, config fails closed without it). `internal/crypto` (round-trip/tamper/wrong-key unit-tested). Host-level volume encryption complements this for the remainder of the DB. |
| **DB-transit TLS** | **IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-15.** Postgres runs `ssl=on` (self-signed cert minted by the compose `db` service) and the backend connects with `sslmode=require`; `ENV=prod` fails closed if the URL ever weakens to disable/prefer (`config.sslEnforced`). TLS at the edge (Traefik + Let's Encrypt) is also live. |
| **MFA (analyst)** | **IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-15.** TOTP (RFC 6238, SHA-1 / 6-digit / 30 s; `internal/auth/totp.go`, RFC-vector-tested) with `/auth/mfa/{enroll,verify,disable}`; the login flow requires a valid code when MFA is enabled and fails closed if the secret can't be decrypted. The secret is stored encrypted at rest. |
| **Certificate pinning (mobile)** | **IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-15.** Both platforms pin the API host to the Let's Encrypt / ISRG roots (X1 + X2): Android via OkHttp `CertificatePinner` (SPKI pins), iOS via an NSURLSession server-trust evaluation in the Ktor Darwin engine (cert-DER pins; the SecTrust is reached through a small cinterop shim because K/N's Foundation binding omits `serverTrust`). Both targets compile green; iOS runtime behavior is device/simulator-verifiable (like the live camera). |
| **On-device face / licence-plate blur** | **IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-11.** Face pixelation runs fully offline before upload: ML Kit face detection (Android) / Apple Vision (iOS) in `Mobile app/shared/src/{android,ios}Main/.../core/media/ImageRedactor.*.kt`, verified output in `test-shots/blur/`. Licence plates are best-effort (text + aspect-ratio heuristic), not a trained plate detector; keep that caveat in any claim. |
| **Automated data-retention / purge job** (incl. partition-DROP purge) | **NOT implemented (roadmap).** Retention SOP is documented; no scheduled purge/retention job exists in code yet. Crypto-shred is now operable in principle (at-rest encryption exists), but the job itself is not built. |
| **On-device photo pruning (mobile)** | **NOT implemented (roadmap).** Captured photos persist in app storage for offline viewing (by design, evidence survives restarts); automated pruning after sync / a retention window is roadmap. |

KEEP IN MIND, these security/privacy controls ARE real and implemented (do not downgrade):
RBAC + audit FKs (server-side, 5 roles, audit actor from token) · public-view coordinate
coarsening (~110 m) + verified-only public reads (`publicProjection` in
`backend/internal/handler/handlers.go`, enforced on reports/map/tiles/stats; `external_viewer`
export denied 403) · TLS at the edge · on-device EXIF stripping · client-side image downscaling ·
idempotent submit · latest-per-building versioning · per-device + per-IP submit rate limits ·
near-duplicate submit guard.

### Other roadmap items

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AI / computer-vision damage suggestion** | **IMPLEMENTED, advisory-only, fully on-device.** MobileNetV3Small transfer-learned on two ground-level datasets: California wildfire structure damage (DINS, CC-BY-4.0) + PEER Hub ImageNet Task 7 post-earthquake damage levels (CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0); the earthquake set was added specifically to fix the previously-weak middle tier. Held-out (4,234 imgs): overall 90.2% (95% CI 89.3–91.1), macro-F1 0.797; per-tier minimal F1 0.915 / partial F1 0.531 / complete F1 0.946; and on real earthquake imagery the partial tier reaches F1 0.662 (recall 0.761), up from F1 0.226 / recall 0.23 on the old wildfire-only model. *(The overall number is lower than the old 94.5% because the new test set is harder + more representative: 3× more 'partial' + real earthquake photos; both macro-F1 and the partial tier improved. See `ml/out/metadata.json`.)* Bundled as TFLite (Android) + Core ML (iOS), wired into capture as a suggestion the reporter confirms or overrides. Model-weights licence: CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 (trained partly on PHI-Net → non-commercial / humanitarian use; Beacon *code* stays Apache-2.0). Domain: wildfire + ground-level earthquake now in-domain; flood/conflict still unvalidated (domain shift); advisory + human-in-the-loop framing is deliberate. |
| **Real identity provider** | Analyst auth is JWT with seeded users; drop-in Azure AD / OIDC on the same JWT contract for production. |
| **Push notifications** | "Crisis alerts when detected nearby", not wired (needs FCM/APNs). |
| **iOS live camera on-device test** | Code builds; live preview only verifiable on a physical iPhone (simulator has no camera). |
| **Brand fonts** | DM Sans/Mono not bundled yet (system font + CJK/Arabic fallback). |

### Admin-boundary / Area follow-ups (from the 2026-06-09 global auto-Area work)
The auto-Area feature ships global ADM tagging: a Natural Earth ADM0 baseline + lazy per-country geoBoundaries ADM1 and, where a COD is published, official OCHA COD-AB ADM1+ADM2 P-codes (`source='cod'`, ranked highest). Status / remaining nuances (COD-AB P-codes are implemented; the rest are follow-ups):
- OCHA COD-AB P-code layer (authoritative), IMPLEMENTED. A `source='cod'` layer is fetched lazily per country from HDX on first report (`internal/boundary/cod.go`; reads both the `adm{n}_pcode` and legacy `ADM{n}_PCODE` attribute schemas), giving official ADM1+ADM2 P-codes that `ResolveAdmin` ranks above geoBoundaries; exports emit `admin*_pcode` (`#loc+admN+code`). Remaining nuance: coverage depends on a country having a published COD on HDX; countries without one fall back to a `GB:`-prefixed geoBoundaries shapeID, disclosed as such in the export so consumers can filter.
- ADM2 (districts). The COD-AB path provides ADM1+ADM2 (parent-linked via the COD parent P-code); the geoBoundaries fallback is ADM1 only.
- ⚠️ License review (ODbL). geoBoundaries gbOpen is OpenStreetMap-derived ODbL 1.0 for many countries (incl. UKR/GTM), NOT CC BY; ODbL has share-alike/attribution obligations heavier than CC BY. Confirm legal is OK with ODbL-sourced boundaries in a UNDP-licensed product, or restrict to gbHumanitarian / OCHA CODs (cleaner licensing). The loader logs `licenseDetail` per country.
- Boundary freshness. Admin boundaries change slowly (months/years), so no live refresh; but version-stamp (`source_version`, already stored) and consider a periodic re-pull; note P-codes can change across COD versions (provenance).
- Country baseline precision. ADM0 baseline is Natural Earth 110m (coarse borders), fine for point→country, but near-border points could misattribute; a finer ADM0 (or per-country geoBoundaries ADM0) would tighten it if needed.

### Crisis model + open-feed ingestion (2026-06-08), deployed & live-verified
- ✅ Crisis = discrete event with spatial extent (`center` + `radius_km`), time window (`started_at`…`ended_at`), `status` (active/proposed/closed/dismissed), optional `response_id` umbrella, GLIDE dedup key (migration `00008`).
- ✅ Reports decoupled from crises: `crisis_id` nullable (= pending); a citizen can report anywhere/anytime. Server assigns by space+time on submit (nearest covering active/proposed crisis), else pending.
- ✅ Emergent crises: a cluster of ≥3 pending reports within 2 km / 24 h auto-creates a `proposed` crisis (source `emergent`), pulls the reports in; analyst confirms (→active) or dismisses (→reports back to pending). The "Shahed/strike reported before any official declaration" case, working.
- ✅ `GET /crises/near?lat&lng`, location-first launch query (distance + covers).
- ⛔️ _(later removed, not in the current build)_ Open disaster-feed ingestion (live): USGS (124 real earthquakes) + GDACS (multi-hazard EQ/TC/FL/WF/DR, Orange+Red, carries GLIDE), background poller (30 min) + analyst `POST /feeds/refresh`; idempotent upsert-by-source-id; pending reports swept into feed crises. Other feeds (ReliefWeb/GLIDE, NASA FIRMS, Copernicus, ACLED) designed + documented in `docs/CRISIS-SOURCES.md`. The USGS/GDACS feed ingestion, the background poller, and `POST /feeds/refresh` were removed, they are NOT in the current build.
- ✅ Verified end-to-end on prod (historical): report at a real epicenter auto-attaches; full emergent confirm/dismiss lifecycle. _(The crisis count cited automated USGS/GDACS feed crises, which were later removed; the emergent confirm/dismiss lifecycle from report clusters remains real.)_

### Recently completed (2026-06-08)
- ✅ Photo binary upload, end-to-end: backend stores the uploaded image on the durable named `beacon-photos` volume, surviving container redeploys (`POST/GET /api/v1/reports/{id}/photo`, `photo_url` column); the mobile app uploads the captured file after submit; the dashboard report detail shows the real photo (browser-verified). (Disk volume, not S3/MinIO, fine for this scale; object store is an easy later swap.)
- ✅ Connectivity self-heals (recompute on every callback + 4 s safety re-check), so the offline banner can't get stuck.
- ✅ Translation is REAL: self-hosted LibreTranslate (open-source MT, no paid API; `beacon-libretranslate` container, UN langs + uk/tr). Descriptions are auto-translated to English on submit (source language auto-detected); the original is always preserved; the dashboard shows a translated/original toggle. Verified live (ru→en).
- ✅ Localization: privacy / camera / Plus-Code / quick-phrase / sync strings updated across ar · es · fr · ru · zh.

## 🤖 AI / Computer Vision — options

**Today (updated 2026-06-12): SHIPPED on both platforms.** The advisory step runs a real
on-device model (MobileNetV3Small → TFLite on Android, Core ML on iOS; see the roadmap
table above and `ml/out/metadata.json`). The section below is kept as the original
option analysis that led to that build.

~~**Today:** the "AI suggests a damage grade from your photo" step is a **stub**, it shows advisory UI but runs no model.~~

Can we do it on mobile? Yes, on-device is the right fit (offline-first + privacy: the photo never leaves the phone):
- Android: TensorFlow Lite / LiteRT (or MediaPipe) running a small image classifier.
- iOS: Core ML (convert the same model).
- Cross-platform: ONNX Runtime Mobile, or a KMP wrapper, sharing one model.

### Are there ready-made models? (researched 2026-06)

No clean drop-in "EMS-98 from a phone photo" model with downloadable, permissively-licensed weights
exists. But you do not train from scratch; there are strong labeled datasets + benchmarks for
transfer learning. Match the INPUT domain: our input is a ground-level facade photo, not satellite.

| Resource | Domain | Damage labels | Weights? | Fit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PEER Φ-Net / PHI-Net** (UC Berkeley) | ground-level **post-earthquake structural** photos (36k) | "damage level" = undamaged / minor / moderate / heavy (+ damage-state, spalling, collapse-mode) | dataset + benchmark tasks; trained weights **not** publicly packaged | Best match, labels ≈ EMS-98 |
| **MEDIC** (QCRI) | ground-level / social-media disaster photos (71k) | damage severity: severe / mild / little | dataset + training scripts (ResNet18 baseline); **no** damage weights; **CC BY-NC-SA (non-commercial)** | Good severity signal; license blocks commercial use |
| **ViT wildfire** (MDPI 2024) | ground-level home photos (18k), 95% acc | severity | data on HF; weights not packaged | Wildfire-only |
| **xBD / xView2** | **satellite / overhead** (850k bldgs) | no / minor / major / destroyed | winning models **open + downloadable** | Wrong input for phone camera, relevant only if we add aerial/drone imagery |

Recommendation (pragmatic middle): transfer-learn a small MobileNet / EfficientNet-Lite (ImageNet
pre-trained) on PEER Φ-Net's "damage level" (4 classes → map to our 3 damage tiers: minimal / partial / complete), advisory only.
Hours-to-days on a modest GPU, not a research project. Verify Φ-Net's license for production; MEDIC is
non-commercial so demo/eval only. Export to TFLite (Android) / Core ML (iOS), ~5–15 MB, <100 ms,
offline; one expect/actual inference seam (mirrors camera/GPS). The model only suggests a grade +
confidence; reporter/analyst always confirms. Not started, needs the fine-tune + go-ahead.
